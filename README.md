> Evolutionary Computation 2025 - Semester 2

This project implements Evolutionary and Submodular Optimisation (ESO) algorithms to solve various optimisation problems such as MaxCoverage, MaxInfluence, and PackWhileTravel.

It includes implementations of both single-objective and multi-objective algorithms (e.g. GSEMO, Genetic Algorithms).

## How to use
1. Navigate to the `code` directory.
2. Choose which script to run:
   - `main.py` — runs (1 + 1) EA and RLS
   - `mainGA.py` — runsGA
   - `mainObjective.py` — runs single-objective and multi-objective EA
   - `gsemo_runner.py` - runs GSEMO
3. Run script with `python {file name}`

Parameters can be customised within the desired script.
